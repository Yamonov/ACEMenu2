# ACEMenu2

The menu bar displays the color settings preset names for Adobe applications.
It shows the contents written in the color settings sync file, “ACEConfigCache2.lst”, so the displayed information may not match the current state of the apps.
To update the display to match the current settings, open the color settings dialog in each app and click OK. This will write the current settings to the sync file.

Even if an Adobe app (Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Bridge, or Acrobat) does not have an entry in the sync file, it will still appear in the menu when running. Selecting an app from the menu will bring it to the front.

You can also display the major version in the menu bar, so you can see the version of the active app at a glance. Unlike Photoshop, InDesign and Illustrator do not show the version number in their own menus, so this feature is useful for users who work with multiple versions.
